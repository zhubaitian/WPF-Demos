# WPF-Demos
A bunch of small demos on quick starting of WPF programing on Windows. The demos are mainly provided by 'DotNet菜园' from his [WPF Introduction](https://www.cnblogs.com/chillsrc/category/684419.html) series.

This visual studio solutons consist of different small projects, following are the brief introduction on each of them. 

### 2-StartApplicationByCode
Mainly demonstrate on how to start the wpf application by code in App.cs rather than using the default App.xaml configuration.

### 3-ApplicationEvents
Application level of events capturing in App.xaml.cs, such as capture application exit event.

### 4-DispatcherAndUIThread
How to update UI controls in another thread by Dispatcher in sync(Dispatcher.Ivoke) and async(Dispatcher.BeginIvoke) methods.

### 6-CanvasLayout
Canvas layout generated by xaml file and code. Some takeaways:
- Canvas layout would not adjust the position of control within it automatically like most of the other containers
- We could use "Canvas.Right|Left|Top|Bottom" Attachedproperty in control within the canvas to adjust the position manually
- If no attachedproperty is set, the controls would be positioning to the top-left of the canvas

### 7-1-WrapPanel
Simple wrappanel layout demo. Wrappanel would organize the controls within in from left to right or from top to bottom automatically, once the controls are out of space in one "row" or "column", it would wrap them and start from another "row" or "column". 

Takeaway:
- The controls within the wrappanel would wrap automatically once out of space in "Row" or "Column"
- We could set Orientation="Horizontal|Vertical" of the wrappanel to specify how the controls within it are placed

### 7-2-StackPanelLayout
Simple stackpanel layout demo. Similar to wrappanel, stackpanel would place the controls within it by row or column automatically, but, it would not wrap automatically.
Takeaway:
- Set Orientation="Vertical|Horizontal" to specify the direction of how controls within it are placed
- By default, every control within it would be with the same width(Orientation=Vertical) or height(Orientail=Horizontal) as the stackpanel, it makes the controls like stacking up together, and I think that's why we call it the stackpanel
