# WPF-Demos
A bunch of small demos on quick starting of WPF programing on Windows. The demos are mainly provided by 'DotNet菜园' from his [WPF Introduction](https://www.cnblogs.com/chillsrc/category/684419.html) series.

This visual studio solutons consist of different small projects, following are the brief introduction on each of them. 

### 2-StartApplicationByCode
Mainly demonstrate on how to start the wpf application by code in App.cs rather than using the default App.xaml configuration.

### 3-ApplicationEvents
Application level of events capturing in App.xaml.cs, such as capture application exit event.

### 4-DispatcherAndUIThread
How to update UI controls in another thread by Dispatcher in sync(Dispatcher.Ivoke) and async(Dispatcher.BeginIvoke) methods.

### 6-CanvasLayout
Canvas layout generated by xaml file and code. Some takeaways:
- Canvas layout would not adjust the position of control within it automatically like most of the other containers
- We could use "Canvas.Right|Left|Top|Bottom" Attachedproperty in control within the canvas to adjust the position manually
- If no attachedproperty is set, the controls would be positioning to the top-left of the canvas
